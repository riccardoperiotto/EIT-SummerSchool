# Summer School
## Project
Delivered project for the two-week Summer School held in Munich for the master degree in Autonomous System (EIT).

The use case we were assigned consisted in developing a solution to define an assembly process for a customizable product starting from its type code (a code that uniquely identifies the product and its customized parts).
In many companies this job is still done using excel files, and the large number of customizable possibilities results in a myriads of combinations, usually difficult to manage. 
To simplify the process, we designed a Finite State Machine that parses each code and creates a JSON file containing the list of the assembly steps needed. 
We modeled the state machine using Enterprise Architect, as suggested during the theoretical lectures.

This repo contains the simple HTML+Javascript+Bootstrap website we developed to interact with the state machine.
