# Summer School (EIT), Munich 2022
This repository contains the report and the project developed for the EIT Summer School held at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in summer 2022.

The title of the Summer School, indicating the main topic covered, was 'IoT Platforms for Industry 4.0'. 
The experience aimed to work in teams on one of the business cases selected by EIT and the collaborating companies for two weeks.

The business case assigned to my team is briefly described in the brochure reported in this repository (see "Brochure.pdf"). The file "Report.pdf" is the report we developed during our work and contains not only a description of the problem analyzed and the proposed solution, but also the business model, the SWOT analysis, and the PESTLE analysis of the product we proposed (i.e. parschnell). 

On the other hand, the Project folder contains the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) developed during the two weeks of Summer School.
